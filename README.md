Customize Firefox Quantum (v57+) New Tab page with `userContent.css`

@NOTE: This was created for personal use and according to my personal taste. Feel free to fork and mess around with the styles.

## Installation

1. In your Firefox [Profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data#w_how-do-i-find-my-profile) folder, create a folder named `chrome` if not already created.

2. Inside `chrome` folder just place `userContent.css` file and `images` folder.

3. Restart Firefox, open a New Tab page and...

4. Enjoy! :smile:
